by empowering subject matter experts to build and maintain their own conversational solutions.

# The business value of Microsoft Power Platform

Many organizations struggle building solutions that help their users be successful. Not only do they
struggle trying to modernize their systems, but they simply don't have the resources required to meet
the ever-changing needs of businesses today. With demands for targeted applications at an all time high
and labour shortaged, it isn't uncommon to see application demand up to 5 times what departments can realistically deliver.

This is not the only challenge facing enterprises today. As the business climate changes, new factors are impacting businesses.
These impacts include;

- __Changing workforce expectations :__ As millennials and Gen Z come to represent most of the workforce, 
  organizations need to adapt to fit the way they work. They have grown up in a world of tailored experiences and
  collaborating through social media. To best apply their abilities, organizations need to be able to deliver more custom,
  to deliver more custom, streamlined, and collaborative digital experiences.
  
- __Increased costs for custom application development :__ Building custom applications and maintaining them is time consuming and expensive.

- __Need to become more agile :__ Historically, solutions can take months to build and roll out. Once deployed, it can take two weeks to
  implement every minor change. We no longer have that luxury. Business strategies and needs change rapidly, so organizations
  need to be able to quickly build solutions based on those changing needs.
- __Need to scale development efficiently :__ To meet ever changing needs, organizations need to change how they develop solutions.
  By responsibly enabling citizen developers (Power Users) as part of development processes, we can create hybrid development teams
  that empower the entire organization to grow.
  
The Power Platform makes it easy for organizations to address all the challenges mentioned above.
The combination of low code tools, along with the ability to leverage enterprise level application development tools,
provide a collaborative solution where citizen developers and professional developers work together to build
targeted solutions based on the needs of the people who will be using these applications every day.

Power Platform helps organizations build solutions that meet their ever-changing needs. It gives organizations the ability
to increase their business agility, by allowing them to to quicklly build application prototypes in hours or days, as
opposed to weeks or months. This ensures by the time the solutions are created, it will still be something that provides
value.
